# Contributing guidelines

**Thanks for considering making contributions to Tendermint!**

Please follow standard github best practices: fork the repo, **branch from the
tip of develop**, make some commits, test your code changes with `make test`,
and submit a pull request to develop.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues) for
things we need help with!

Please make sure to use `gofmt` before every commit - the easiest way to do
this is have your editor run it for you upon saving a file.

You can read the full guide [on our
site](https://tendermint.com/docs/guides/contributing).
